# Final-Project

## Work as a Team
Once a topic has been agreed upon, each member will be assigned a role, indicated by a particular shape: square, triangle, circle, and X. Each shape, or role, will have an assigned task.
The X role is mandatory for teams of four and optional for teams of three. Later, we'll cover how the designations will work. For now, review the following deliverable requirements for the first segment:
•	Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.
•	Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
•	Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.
•	X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.
