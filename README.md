Music is the combination of rhythm and harmony that creates melodies and songs.
It goes beyond the range of time, space, and cultures. Throughout the years, music has evolved and transformed helping to create various genres of songs, which are combinations of melodies and lyrics. 

From electric guitars to auto-tunes, songs have been through some massive transformations. Therefore, we have selected this topic to analyze how songs have evolved, for better or worse, throughout the years. We want to create a data frame that can project the genre(s) which have been consistently to be on the top.

We are also trying to get the answers to the questions, such as, 

1. Which genre (album or singles) has been consistently on the top?
2. Which artist has the highest number of streams?
3. How long has the song been at the top?

## Source Data
Below are the sources that we will be using to answer the questions stated above.

### Database
   - For our project we are using Amazon's AWS RDS service.
        - We plan to use this webservice to best share our data when going through and performing our machine learning models.  This will also help with any other transformations we may implement during our analysis.
   - See below images for screenshots of the sucessfully created database and the ability to conect to said database.
