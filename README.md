# Final-Project

## Work as a Team
Once a topic has been agreed upon, each member will be assigned a role, indicated by a particular shape: square, triangle, circle, and X. Each shape, or role, will have an assigned task.
The X role is mandatory for teams of four and optional for teams of three. Later, we'll cover how the designations will work. 

- Square role: will be responsible for the repository.
- Triangle role: will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.
- Circle role: will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.
-	Optional- X role: will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.
