Top Streamed Songs on Spotify

## why?

Music is the combination of rhythm and sound that creates melodies and songs.
Music goes beyond the range of time, space, and cultures. Throughout the past 100 years, music has evolved and transformed helping to create various genres of songs, which are combination
of melodies and lyrics. 

From electric guitars to auto tunes, songs have been through some massive transformations. Therefore, we have selected this topic in order to analyze how the songs have evolved, for better or worse, through out the years. We want to create a dataframe that can project the genre(s) which have or has 
been the most consistent to be on the top.

We are also trying to get the answers to the questions, such as, 

1. Which genre (album or singles) has been the most consistent to be on the top?
2. Which artist has higher number of streams?
3. How long the song has been on the chart?

## Source Data
Below are some of the sources that we will be using to answer the questions stated above.
